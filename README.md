# 🕹️ GAT150: Game Application Toolkit

GAT150 is a modular C++ game framework built for educational game development. It provides a clean architecture for rendering, input handling, asset management, and scene control—ideal for students, hobbyists, and developers exploring engine design fundamentals.

This project was developed as part of the GAT150 course curriculum and emphasizes hands-on learning through real-time systems, SDL2 integration, and object-oriented design.
